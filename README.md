# Euro-Exchange-Rate-Analysis
The dataset shown illustrates the correlation between the Euro and other currencies around the world. 
For example, a value in the U.S. Dollar column might say 1.6228. This means that one Euro is worth 1.6338 dollars that day. 
The first column has the date for every value.
I will use that row to analyze and visualize correlation between currencies across a period of time. 
Before I do any of that, I will have to clean the data to make sure that the numbers are accurate and the data conveys a clear message. I will be using mardowns to illustrate what I'm trying to accomplish.

The data I will be working with can be found on Kaggle.
